# CNN-Based Figure Understanding Module

This module is an experimental feature to analyze figures and diagrams in research papers.

## Approach

1. Figures are extracted from PDFs.
2. Images are processed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
3. Visual embeddings are generated for charts, plots, and architectures.
4. Visual embeddings are combined with text embeddings during retrieval.

## Goal

The goal is to enable multimodal understanding of scientific papers, not just text-based QnA.
This feature is experimental and intended for future improvement.
